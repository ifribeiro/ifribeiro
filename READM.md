# About me

I am a doctoral student at the Universidade Federal do EspÃ­rito Santo ([UFES](https://informatica.ufes.br/pt-br/pos-graduacao/PPGI)) and researcher at the Multimedia and Networking Research Lab ([LPRM](https://lprm.inf.ufes.br/)) since November 2021. I hold a Master's degree in Computer Science from the same university, and a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the Universidade Estadual do Sudoeste da Bahia ([UESB](http://www.uesb.br/)).

## :microscope: Research interests

My main interest areas are Urban Computing, Urban Mobility, Mobile and Opportunistic Networks, Data Science, and Machine Learning. You can find my recent resarch (mostly in Portuguese ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· , for now) in my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6-8aD00AAAAJ&hl=en) or [Research Gate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Iran-Ribeiro) profiles.

## ðŸ“Œ Projects

Currently, most of my code here is in Python and is related to my past/current research. Some of them are just projects from a specific class I took. However, I have used other languages in personal and professional projects such as Java (mainly on my undergraduate degree), Javascript, and PHP.
Here's a summary of what I have done:

### :computer: Machine Learning

- [Machine Learning Basics](https://github.com/ifribeiro/machine_learning) - Sampling Methods, PCA, Clustering, Decision Trees
- [Natural computing](https://github.com/ifribeiro/natural_computing) - Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Evolution Strategies (ES), Differential Evolution (DE)
- [Generative Adversarial Networks](https://github.com/ifribeiro/) - Using GANs for mobility generation. Unfortunately, I can't make the repo public yet, but some results are in 2th paper in my Scholar profile

### Robotics

- [Drone Formation Controller (ROS)](https://github.com/ifribeiro/ros-formation-controller)

### Educational Software

- [Educational Game](https://github.com/ifribeiro/Memorizando) - Bachelor's final project
